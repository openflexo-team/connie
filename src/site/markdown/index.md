# Introduction to CONNIE

CONNIE is a Java library allowing to define and execute an expression-based language over a generic API.

This language is generally used to connect heterogeneous technologies with the same API.

The purpose of CONNIE is to offer the ability to:

* Navigate through a graph of objects mixing heterogeneous technologies.
  
* Define strong-typed paths and expressions.

* Execute strong-typed paths and expressions.

Contents of this package

CONNIE project contains two separate components (defined here as modules):
  
* [Connie-core component](/connie-core/index.md), which contains the Connie core library itself
  
* [Some utilities](/connie-utils/index.md) which are used in whole Openflexo infrastructure
